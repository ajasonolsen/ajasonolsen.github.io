         Hello, my name is Finn Donnelly, this is a test to see if this will work. I have little no idea what Iâ€™m doing in this class but I think it would be a good skill to understand so Iâ€™m going to work on this html stuff until I understand it. Next time I should start a little bit more ahead of time but I think Iâ€™m still understanding it. I actually do find this pretty interesting and while it probably will not become my forte I do see it as a good skillset to put under my belt. My question is how in a day where websites such as wix and squarespace etc. exist and make websites for such a small amount of money, at what point is the web designer driven out of business. I guess that is the dilemna of all art though.
