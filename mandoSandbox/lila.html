    <h1>Thanks to Eko on behalf of the community of makers</h1>

    <p>Like Wirewax, Eko was a pioneering force in interactive video, inspiring audiences and creators alike since it was founded by musician Yoni Bloch and others in 2010. Long before founding Stornaway, we have been in the interactive video space since the early 2000s and have watched and admired their journey, from groundbreaking projects like 2013’s TV-switching Like A Rolling Stone video for Bob Dylan, to the BBC’s interactive Casualty episode in 2015 and The Daniels’ Possibilia in 2017 (which paved the way for their Academy Award-winning Everything Everywhere All At Once). Eko has shown some amazing possibilities for interactive storytelling, and as a community we are grateful for the creative sparks they’ve ignited over the years. They raised over $20m for interactive video growth, then partnered with Walmart on a $250m deal focusing on products and shopping in 2019, and now have pivoted fully to AI product videos while Stornaway drives forward the innovation in interactive video experiences. We always considered ourselves complementary, not competitive – and we wish them the best.</p>
