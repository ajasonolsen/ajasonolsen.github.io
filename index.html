            <p>Servings: 3-4</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 tablespoons of neutral oil, such as grape seed or avocado</li>
                    <li>1/2 red, white, or yellow onion, small diced</li>
                    <li>1/2 green or red bell pepper, small diced</li>
                </ul>
                        

            <p>Instructions</p>

            <p>Take the tofu and lightly press out the water with both hands. This also can be achieved by wrapping the tofu with paper towels, then giving it 1-2 good presses.  A little leftover water is okay—this should be a quick process and the tofu shouldn’t be too dry (I have had my share of extra dry tofu scrambles). I find a quick press along with sautéing it makes for a delicious tofu scramble.</p>

            <p>Starting with a hot pan, add oil, onion, and bell pepper, and sauté until translucent. Then crumble the tofu into the pan with your hands; any larger chunks can be broken up with a spatula. Add all spices and nutritional yeast. Make sure you get all the spices mixed well into the tofu. Then toss in the tomatoes, cilantro, and spinach. Once the spinach is wilted, sprinkle vegan shredded cheese on top. Turn off heat, then cover; leave covered for 2 minutes. The residual heat will melt the plant-based cheese without drying out the tofu.</p>

            <p>Spoon your Spanish tofu scramble on a plate, add suggested toppings. Serve with warm tortillas.</p>

            <p><em>Chef’s TIP: Add the tomatoes after the tofu so they stay fresh.</em></p>
